HARD IN THE PAINT
=====

A two-player game created for the University of Toronto 2013 Hackathon. Players are set in a 2-dimensional grid 
world with tiles, obstacles (walls), security cameras, and police force members.

The object of the game is to assume control of all, or at least most of, the conquerable tiles in the 
game (non-wall tiles). There are security cameras set to survey areas which are borderer-lined in red; which,
in the case that a player goes over the area, will alert the nearest police force member of the player. The closest 
police force member will then chase the player. In the case that the player comes into contact with a police force member,
he/she will be disallowed to move for a period of 3 seconds. The police member moves away, and then, the game continues
as usual.
